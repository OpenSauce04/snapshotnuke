# snapshotnuke

A small script which automates the mass-deletion of local macOS Time Machine snapshots which naturally accumulate over time.

I create all of my Time Machine backups on an external drive, so these local snapshots that macOS litters my internal storage with are just wasted space.

The process of deleting these snapshots manually can be a little time consuming depending on the number of them present, and in this instance, quickly slapping together this script was likely faster than the former option.
